# I'm Ivy Mead, a Senior Data Analyst based in Portland, Maine.

## Career path:
After 10 years at the lab bench working as a Translational Scientist specialized in regenerative medicine and molecular/immunoassay development, I decided I needed a change of pace and realized that data analysis was the highlight of my days as a scientist. I have carried my transferrable skills into a new career in data science as a Data Analyst. I have previous experience working to deliver data and insights for Operations, specializing in Supply Chain and Logistics. Now I work in Financial Tech. 

I hold a BA in Biological Sciences from Smith College and a MSc in Translational Sciences from Wake Forest University.

## Currently working on: 
Improving my Git skills, as well as learning [Julia](https://juliacomputing.com/).

In my free time, I am learning to make music in [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

## Experience in:
 SAS, R, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, JMP, SQL, SAP HANA, Jira, Confluence, PowerBI, Snowflake, Smartsheet, and Notion.
